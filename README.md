# Data-Analysis-ML-Accuracy-and-Decision-Trees
 This project explores the impact of training set size and decision tree depth on model accuracy. Using Python and Scikit-learn, we create a decision tree with entropy criterion and visualize accuracy trends with varying training set sizes and tree depths. We output the decision tree to a PDF and generate accuracy graphs for analysis.
